# 🐷 Angry Bird 3: Revenge of the Pigs

> **The tables have turned. The birds are attacking, and this time... the Pigs are fighting back!**

**Revenge of the Pigs** is a fast-paced HTML5 arcade shooter where you play as the Green Pig defending your territory against waves of angry birds. Built entirely with vanilla JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API (no external image assets required!).

## 🎮 The Concept
For years, the Pigs have been the targets. Now, they have built their own launcher. In this "Reverse Shooting" twist on the classic game:
* **You control the Pig** (ground-based defender).
* **The Enemies are the Birds** (flying overhead).
* **The Ammo is Eggs** (ironic justice!).

## ✨ Features
* **Zero Dependencies:** Runs purely on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* **Procedural Graphics:** All characters (Pigs, Birds, Eggs) are drawn in real-time using code—no image files to load!
* **High Score System:** Tracks your best performance in the current session.
* **Unlockable Rewards:** Beat your high score to unlock new cosmetic egg colors (Gold, Red, Black, Purple).
* **Responsive Design:** Scales to fit different screen sizes.
